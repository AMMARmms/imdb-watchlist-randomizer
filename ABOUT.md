# About the Extension
I will be using the word multimedia for movie, tv-series, documentary etc.
### How to use?
- If it is your first usage, then you have to open any public watchlist or your own private watchlist.
- Then you need to `SCAN & RANDOMIZE` first which will scan your content and cache them. Also will give you your first result.
- Now, `RANDOMIZE` button will be anabled which basically randomly picks a multimedia from cached watchlist real quick.
- Save your options and click randomize as much as you want. You will be able to see all results until you close the popup.
- When you reopen the popup you will only see your latest randomization if there is one. The app doesn't store history for now.

### How long does it take to scan?
I created a new account and added IMDB Top250 to my watchlist ([Watchlist](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur135486613/watchlist?ref_=nv_usr_wl_all_0) is public and I won't touch it if you like to use it as a IMDB Top250 randomizer) and it took 30 seconds. In my primary account I had around 700 and it took around a minute. You can make a guess for your watchlist based on these as well.

### Why some information are missing on my randomized multimedia?
It's because the scanner waits some time for page to load multimedia content, but it skips to the next one when the time is over. So, it may skip some detail if page couldn't load that data meanwhile (usually the poster). If you are having a lot of missing information, it may be because of your internet speed. I may add a button for slower scanning later.
**TIP:** After scanning once, scan again without reloading the page. 

### Which data is stored on my account and which is stored locally?
Your options and latest randomization result is stored in your account so you can access them anywhere by enabling syncing.
Your scanned watchlist is only stored locally as it can get a lot bigger than the sync allows us to store.

### Do I lose my cached watchlist if I `SCAN & RANDOMIZE` another person's watchlist?
Yes, the app only stores the latest scanned watchlist on your cache. Also be aware of that if you `SCAN & RANDOMIZE` and later add new multimedias to your watchlist, they won't be in the cached watchlist as you can guess. So you need to rescan.
