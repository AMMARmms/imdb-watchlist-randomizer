# IMDB Watchlist Randomizer

A browser extension that allows users to filter & randomly pick a movie, tv-series etc, from an IMDB watchlist.

- Developed with Chrome on Windows 10.
- Manifest Version: V3. Haven't configured for other browsers yet.
- No configuration, so it may not work on older browsers.

I suggest you to read [About the App](https://github.com/AlkTheOrg/imdb-watchlist-randomizer/blob/main/ABOUT.md#about-the-extension) before using the extension.
